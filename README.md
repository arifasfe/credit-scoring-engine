# Credit Scoring Engine for Loan Disbursement
As a part of our industrial attachment at upay, our assigned project is about developing a credit scoring system for Upay users. It will use machine learning to predict the likelihood of a user receiving a loan, based on data such as transaction history and customer information. The goal is to make loan disbursement more efficient and precise, and to offer decision makers insights into customer loan eligibility. A user interface is also being developed to allow users to upload data files and receive loan decisions, loan probability assessments, and suggested loan amounts.

## Features
* Use of machine learning to predict the likelihood of a user receiving a loan
* Delivery of an efficient and precise credit scoring system
* Facilitation of loan disbursement decision-making
* Offer of insights into customer loan eligibility and the potential loan amount they could receive

## User Interface
We have created a demo user interface using react in the front-end and django in the back-end along with the integration of our trained machine learning model.
